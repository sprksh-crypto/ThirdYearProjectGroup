## TODO

*Yige: mini-game

*Omar and Ashwin: SpaceShip mode

*Duncan: Phenomena

*JJ and Swathi: Menu and Stats


*(omar I don't wanna get copyright issues by NASA, so if you do use it make sure we aren't going to get in trouble, i.e plagerism and issues the College might come up with, idk)

*(yige when you finish the game then try and work with omar and ashwin on how to put them together?)


Hopefully we'll be done by Wednesday?Thursday and can put it all together, we'll find a time to meet when it gets closer?
