# **Omar Khawaja** VR Astrophysics Project

Here I will be uploading my project files. I will do my best to keep files organised, and will upload the final version of my scripts closer to the end of the Project as I will be making continous changes. Sicne I have a lot of files, it may be easier for me to upload everything to the my own Git Respository near the end. 

## Space Ship

Here I have uploaded all files pertaning to my Space Ship, for the final group project. 

The file named:
```
Omar Shuttle Prefab.prefab
```
Is the Prefab that containts the 3D Shuttle, 'Engines', the Camera and other neccesary components. 

All the Animation files as well as the controller file are included.  

Attach the:
```
Flying.sc
``` 
to the main Camera, nott the Spaceship/Shuttle.

``` 

* Calculates and sets the intial velocity.
